# Doctren

The public research site for Doctren, published at [doctren.com](https://doctren.com). Plain HTML and CSS, built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), searchable with [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/), and hosted free on Netlify.

## Publish a new report

1. Copy `report-template.md` into `src/reports/` and rename it, for example `src/reports/volunteer-retention.md`. The file name becomes the web address: `/reports/volunteer-retention/`.
2. Fill in the details at the top (title, description, date, topic, authors) and write the report below it. Each `##` heading becomes an entry in the contents list.
3. Put the PDF and thumbnail image in `src/files/`, and point `pdf:` and `thumbnail:` at them (e.g. `/files/volunteer-retention.pdf`). Thumbnails look best at 3:2, around 1200 × 800 px.
4. Delete the `draft: true` line when it's ready.
5. Commit and push (or upload the files on github.com). Netlify rebuilds the site in about a minute.

The new report appears automatically on the home page (the newest report is featured), in All research, in its topic page, and in search.

### Bangla edition

Make a second file, e.g. `src/reports/volunteer-retention-bn.md`, with `lang: bn` and `english: /reports/volunteer-retention/` at the top. In the English file add `bangla: /reports/volunteer-retention-bn/`. A language switch then appears on both pages. Bangla copies are not listed twice.

## Change site settings

Edit `src/_data/site.js` for the site name, contact email, social media links and the list of topics. A report's `topic:` must match one of the topic names exactly.

## Contact form

The form on `/contact/` uses Netlify Forms. Messages appear in the Netlify dashboard under **Forms**, and you can turn on email notifications there.

## Run it on your computer

```bash
npm install
npm start        # live preview at http://localhost:8080 (search works after a build)
npm run build    # full build with search, output in _site/
```

## Put it online (first time only)

1. Sign in to [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/) with GitHub.
2. **Add new site → Import an existing project → GitHub**, and pick this repository.
3. The settings are read from `netlify.toml`, so just press **Deploy**.
4. Optional: add your own domain under **Domain management**, then update `url` in `src/_data/site.js`.
